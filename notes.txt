    next:
        -main dashboard grid (for now: lights: status of each, link to manage, lists: 'coming soon')
        -lightpanel grid (almost there, make title look nicer)
        -link up 'manage' button for each to :id view (should be just that light's info as a switch- this will be the view our iphone4 uses for the closet light)
            -where should I have the 'edit title', 'edit groups' logic?
            TODO NEXT-single view works,but many errors and might not be properly updating state.  check it out!

    make sure updates are pushed live (if update from app, we want the webapp to update live, as the old iphone4 will serve as the on-site switch for the closet)

    test app: react native
