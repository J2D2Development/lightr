    next:
        -main dashboard grid (for now: lights: status of each, link to manage, lists: 'coming soon')
            -in main 'cardmedia' element, create chart of useage, # and type of lists, etc?
        -manage for each ind light should have brightness and name change functionality
            -currently working but could be better.  LightSwitchIndividualView.js file- find better styling for normal title vs input field edit (more consistent).  Possible to add animation (horizontal transition) on change?
        set node env variable for hue api username?
            -won't work until we have a prod server?
        -set up light groups area of app  
            -create/manage groups.
        -find host and link up (probably firebase hosting to enable google login eventually)
            -be sure to npm run build for prod build and push that to firebase hosting
            -find domain name!
            -won't need auth for now: lights only work if you're on the same network
        -implement fetch and promises polyfill (ip4 only has ios/safari V7- no native fetch or promises)
            https://github.com/github/fetch
            https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill
                -both installed, working?  not yet sure.
            -check on react- will it work in a version of safari that old?  a2 doesn't seem to :<(
                -if all else fails, buy super cheap android phone and put chrome on it.  That will eliminate this issue and eliminate the need for polyfills above!
        -test on laptop from outside home network (should fail to load lights info).  add nice 'no access' msg, but allow access to other areas if logged in.
            -successfully fails (ha!).  Makes sense- it's requesting access to a local network address (192) that doesn't exist.  just need to add a check for that and notice on failure.
        -loading animation  
            -small and large (for individual cards and overall)

    when done post launch:
        create new branch for refactoring
            -a lot of repeated methods on Dashboard.js for lights vs groups- find a way to share!

    make sure updates are pushed live (if update from app, we want the webapp to update live, as the old iphone4 will serve as the on-site switch for the closet)

    test app: react native
