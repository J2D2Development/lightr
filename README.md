# Lightr
*A work in progress home improvement project*

### The idea
Using Phillips Hue "Smart" lighting, create a web interface to light different areas of our home

### The reason
Both closets in the master bedroom lack a light switch.  One has an overhead light you can plug in to turn on.  The other has a headlamp hanging from a nail.  I am not an electrician.  I am, however, a software developer.  Phillips has created a product whereby one can control lightbulbs via a web application.

### Planned technologies
-Node to serve my web interface (start without Express, but may bring it in)
-ES6 based custom UI (may end up using React)
-Eventually a PWA?
-Phillips provides a pretty cool API
